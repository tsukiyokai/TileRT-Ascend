#
# `kbenv` answers a different question and answered it wrongly for the one
# host that mattered: 7.150.10.78 read 占用 with 0 of 16 dies free while every
# card sat at 4 percent, because an idle `vllm` process name decides the
# verdict before HBM is consulted and a die npu-smi did not report counts as
# taken. Three hosts were abandoned on that reading before this scan found the
# machine that was free all along.
#
# The pool rejects key authentication and then reports a correct password as
# "Permission denied", so password auth is forced rather than offered.

#
# A line of eight percentages is the eight cards; low everywhere means the
# dies are yours whatever the process list says. `holder` names the tenant.
